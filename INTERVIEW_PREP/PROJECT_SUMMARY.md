# NeuroIntel AI OS - Project Summary

## 🚀 One-Liner Pitch
NeuroIntel AI OS is a futuristic, web-based "Cyber-Clinical" operating system designed for neurologists to upload, analyze, and visualize MRI scan data in real-time, featuring a high-fidelity glassmophism UI and simulated AI diagnostics.

## 🎯 Core Problem Solved
Traditional medical interfaces are often clunky and outdated. This project demonstrates how **Patient Experience (PX)** and **User Experience (UX)** in healthcare can be revolutionized using modern web technologies, providing a seamless, "Operator-like" experience for specialists.

## 🔑 Key Features
1.  **High-Performance File Handling**: Uploads large MRI video sequences (up to 100MB) using streamed buffering.
2.  **Real-Time Analysis Engine**: Simulates AI processing (cortical mapping, anomaly detection) using WebSockets (Socket.io) for live feedback.
3.  **Cyber-Clinical UI**: A custom design system built with CSS Variables, Glassmorphism, and Holographic effects (no component libraries).
4.  **Secure Authentication**: JWT-based auth system for securing clinical data.
5.  **Universal Deployment**: Dockerized container ensuring the app runs identically on local machines, cloud servers, or AI spaces (Hugging Face).

## 🛠 Tech Stack Overview
| Component | Technology | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | React + Vite | Fast HMR, component-based architecture for complex UIs. |
| **Backend** | Node.js + Express | Non-blocking I/O ideal for handling file streams and real-time events. |
| **Database** | MongoDB Atlas | Schema-less flexibility for storing variable patient metadata. |
| **Real-time** | Socket.io | Bi-directional communication for live analysis progress bars. |
| **Styling** | Vanilla CSS + Animations | Performance and complete control over the "Sci-Fi" aesthetic. |
| **DevOps** | Docker + Hugging Face | Containerization for "Write Once, Run Anywhere" reliability. |
