## ⚡ Overview
**NeuroIntel AI OS** is a high-fidelity, web-based operating system designed for modern neurologists. Unlike traditional, clunky medical software, NeuroIntel provides a **Minority Report-style** glassmorphism interface for uploading, visualizing, and analyzing high-resolution MRI scan sequences in real-time.

It combines **Socket.io** real-time streaming with a simulated **Deep Learning Engine** to provide instant feedback on cortical anomalies, tumor detection, and neural density.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **🖥️ Cyber-Clinical Interface**: A bespoke design system featuring holographic glassmorphism, HUD elements, and smooth fluid animations.
*   **📡 Real-Time Analysis Stream**: Process 100MB+ MRI sequences with live progress tracking via WebSockets.
*   **🧠 AI Diagnostics Engine**: Automated detection of anomalies with confidence scoring and heatmap generation (Simulated).
*   **🔐 Secure Operator Access**: JWT-encrypted authentication for secure operator sessions.
*   **☁️ Universal Deployment**: Dockerized architecture ready for Cloud, On-Premise, or Edge deployment.
